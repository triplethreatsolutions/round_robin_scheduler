Description: Generic schedulers for competitions
        ===================================
        
        The goal of this package is to provide high-quality, randomized schedule
        generators for competitions, particularly leagues. The schedulers generate
        lists of rounds for competitions when provided a list of teams or a team count.
        
        Right now, this library supports schedule generation for pure round-robin
        competitions. While special wrappers are provided for round-robin leagues with
        between 1 and 4 meetings between teams, competitions with more meetings
        are possible.
        
        There will be a v0.3, but I don't know what should be in it. Should I clone
        scheduling formulas from real sports leagues? Do you want knockout cups, playoffs,
        or more predictable round-robin scheduling? I won't know unless you tell me.
        Open feature requests on this project's GitHub repo and tell me what you want to
        see in version 0.3!
